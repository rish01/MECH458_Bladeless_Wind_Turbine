# Capstone Project - Bladeless Wind Turbine GUI

In order to use the GUI, simply run the BWT_GUI.exe file located in [BWT_GUI/bin/Release](https://github.com/rish01/MECH458_Bladeless_Wind_Turbine/blob/master/BWT_GUI/bin/Release/BWT_GUI.exev) folder. <br/> <br/>

The GUI serves multiple purposes:
1. Fetch amplified potentiometer analog values and compute the angular position and velocity of the mast.
2. Fetch the amplified analog values of emf and current generated in the coil by the oscillatory motion of the magnet over the coil.
3. Display the angular position and emf generated on a plot in real-time. 
4. Add bias up and down arrows to zero point calibrate the position and emf.
5. Provide user the ability to save the data to a csv file of user-defined name.
